## Introduction

NeoVim is a powerful text editor that I've customized to suit my workflow and preferences. This repository contains the configuration files and settings that make up my personalized NeoVim setup. My setup is based on the basic structure proposed in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8). Starting from this I then adapted the various plugins to my use case (experimental physics student: c++, pyhton, latex, markdown).

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed to use this NeoVim configuration:

1. **[NeoVim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)**: (v0.9.4 recommended);
2. **[Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for Icons**;

3. **True-Color Terminal**: requested by the color theme, I'm using alacritty, but any true color terminal should be fine; 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NicoloSalimbeni/nvim-configuration ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. Enter the downloaded folder, then in the file path nvim/lua/nicolo/ you will find a file called plugins-setup.lua, open it and save it with :w . Inside this file there is a function which every time the file is saved installs all the plugins. Since you just downloaded everything you need to install them for the first time.

3. Enjoy your new NeoVim setup!
